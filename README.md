# OpenGL-3D-Scene

- How do I approach designing software?
    

	- In working on this project, I have learned that there are steps that can be taken to ensure that a codebase is readable and maintainable. For example, instead of recreating meshes each time in the main class, I could easily create a separate class or header file that is called anytime a new object is created. For this project, I tried to compartmentalize parts of the codebase so that is was readable. An example of this would be the places where I have grouped code by which shape or object was being effected. In the future I would like to pull out the code of the shader programs and have them as a header file in order to organize the codebase a little. 

- How do I approach developing programs?
   	- The first step to developing any program is assessing requirements. After those are well established, planning out design and implementation can begin. For this project, a good amount of time went into the planning phase. I first needed to decide which shapes I would use to create my scene. I then had to think about placement, lighting navigation, and texture. After I had that decided, I could begin implementation. Each milestone I was able to refine this process, as each milestone involved iterating over each step of the SDLC. 

-  How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 
	- For me, the biggest take away in this class, apart for the obvious technical skills required to render 3D objects, was critical thinking and problem solving. Making sure each milestone was meeting the requirements took a lot of effort and time. However, with consistency, this process became easier. I believe this is a lesson I can take with me to any job as a software engineer. In the same notion, the skills I have obtained from this project is something I plan to build upon, so I can use OpenGL as a creative outlet at some point.
